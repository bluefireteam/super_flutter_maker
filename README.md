An awesome game, using Flame.

Super Flutter Maker is an online community where people train their knowlogde about the Flutter Widgets, by solving puzzles using the widgets themselves.

Giving a certain layout, the player needs to arrange them correctly to match the pre constructed widget to win the challenge.

The game will feature a community where people can create these challenges and share with others, so the challenge library is always new and fresh.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to allow Flutter developers all around the world, new and experienced alike, to discover cool problems and challenges to have fun and improve their skills on building interfaces with Flutter.

We all know a major part of building Flutter app is to get more acquainted with the Widgets available and how to compose then to create the interface of your dreams.

In this project, challenges have goals witch are, simply put, interfaces to be developed. Players can select a challenge and go to our interactive builder, where they can code the way they think the interface is developed. They can see the results in the preview screen and then verify if the result is correct.

We wanted a mobile first experience, so we streamlined the coding experience by using blocks instead of actual code, insofar as minimizing the amount of typing required. However, we **do not** provide any sort of layout builder, WYSIWYG editor or block dragging magic machanism for the player. Our "blocks" are precisely the code that would be written otherwise, and the resulting structure looks very similar (1:1 relationship) with the code that would be written by traditional means (if formatted). Visually, you will see the connection. Our goal is to provide a way that developers can learn how to code using Flutter's reactive model of declarative interfaces, while on the go and possibly keyboard-less, instead of providing a new way to build interfaces. If we improve to have a desktop version, we can allow regular coding as well (via typing). 

As of so far, only some pre-set challenges are available, and the idea is only to showcase the platform. A few widgets have been created, but the structure used allows for easily adding new content.

The idea is to grow the project later to have more pre-set challenges, organized into trials or paths that increase in difficult and might test specific concepts as well, together with a collaborative hub where people can create, share and rank challenges.

Also in the collaborative spectrum, we intend to add later a better win screen, where not only you'd find out if you win or not, but will be able to see and compare your solution with the ones other people have submited before, so if there are more than one way to achieve a certain go, you can find out more efficient ways and learn about new widgets. There you'd be able to connect even more with people around the globe.

This was heavily inspired the [FLEXBOX FROGGY](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) website. It's an interactive experience where you must move frogs using only CSS Flexbox properties.

This was developed during the Internation Flutter Hackathon 2019, in the Dextra - Campinas - SP - Brazil Hub, under the MIT liecense.
